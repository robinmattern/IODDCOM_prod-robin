        One of our members had the original idea for the Institute of Database
        Developers to build a database and web site to support
        national &quot;Clean Up&quot; activities. We believe that by giving
        permanent credit to the volunteers and sponsors via the Internet, we
        will add new enthusiasm for a clean America. We hope to involve the
        White House in support of this non-controversial project. Our contacts
        with the Sierra Club and other organizations indicate solid support
        outside of government, which should increase our chances with the new
        administration.</font>
        <p><font size="2"><b>CONCEPT: </b>Groups all over America do volunteer work all the time by cleaning
        up areas that need it. For example the Sierra Club has on-going
        projects that clean up rivers. Currently the work is done; everyone
        benefits, but no one gets lasting credit. For the most part, it is a
        silent deed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">But when you give credit by acknowledging the volunteers personally
        and permanently, a new dynamic is added. You will see more volunteers
        for many new reasons. You will see more sponsors. Public contests will
        take place about who does the best job. Governors, schools and
        civic clubs will challenge for bragging rights.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The best way to do this is through a permanent and accessible
        listing of clean up activities on the Internet. The proposed project
        will be called &quot;123 Clean Up&quot;. The 123 means 3 Steps:</font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><b><font size="2">Organize a clean up activity.</font></b></li>
          <li><b><font size="2">Do the clean up.</font></b></li>
          <li><b><font size="2">Log on to 123cleanup.org and report your accomplishments.</font></b></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="2"><b>THE WEB SITE PLAN: </b>The IODD has the greatest skill set of any group in the country for
        this kind of project. We focus on this kind of task every day. Our
        experience with very large data transfers and live updating by
        individuals make this a routine project. We have the resources to
        provide servers and connectivity for the initial phases, therefore no
        cash is required to kick this web site off.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">After a clean up effort is completed in some area of the country, a
        person will logon to 123CleanUp.org. The following items will be asked
        for:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2">The person's name and other contact information</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">The sponsor of the clean up effort and contact info, if any</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">The location cleaned with City, County, State etc.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">The estimated number of equivalent green yard trash bags
            collected</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">The dates of the effort</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">A description with anecdotes etc.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">The names and ages of all volunteers</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2">With this information coming in from all over the country we can
        produce great statistics, like:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2">Which City or County or State collected the most by week by
            month and by year. (Suppose the White House would give a monthly
            or annual award the winners.)</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">A volunteer &quot;Wall of Fame&quot; with the name of every
            volunteer and their ages when they participated. (Imagine school
            children looking their names up on the Internet when they are 10,
            and doing it again when they are 30 to show their children.)</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">Charts would show the increasing numbers of tons of trash
            removed from our environment by volunteers sweat, not government
            dollars.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2"><b>THE PROMOTION PLAN: </b>As always, success of a project like this requires solid promotion
        and a good sponsor. Members Bruce Troutman and Bruce Parker have some
        personal and professional contacts that should open some doors to
        further this goal. And .. with a little imagination, you might see the
        whole world participating.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">For further information contact Bruce Troutman at <a href="mailto:bruce.troutman@iodd.com">bruce.troutman@iodd.com</a>
        or 703-725-8020.</font> </td>
