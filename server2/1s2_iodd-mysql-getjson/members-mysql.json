Most of these systems are SQL-based. With the advent and popularity of the Windows 2000 server operating system, have also integrated SQL 7.0 and Active Directory as resource for validation, control, and security on web sites. Researching XML & WSH scripting for true cost/time savings without uprooting existing systems. Applied efficient modularity for usage of new tools. In problem-solving or decision-making situations, always sought solutions with calculated risk and common-sense reality",
