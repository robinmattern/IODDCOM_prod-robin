				<td>FIELDWORK DETERMINATION AUTHORIZING USE OF GOVERNMENT 
				PASSENGER CARRIER(S) FOR HOME-TO-WORK TRANSPORTATION PURSUANT TO 
				FEDERAL MANAGEMENT REGULATION (FMR), PART 102-5<p>Determination 
				Control Number 04-9F-001</p>
				<p>The Administrator makes the following determination and 
				approval of use under FMR, Part102-5</p>
				<p>1. The following associate of the General Services 
				Administration (GSA), Federal Supply Service, is authorized to 
				use Government-owned, -leased, or -controlled motor vehicle for 
				transportation between her residence and place of&nbsp; GSA 
				employment for the purpose of conducting fieldwork for this 
				agency:</p>
				<p>Supply Management Specialist</p>
				<p>Phoenix, AZ</p>
				<p>2. The above-listed associate performs her duties by visiting 
				customers, attending conferences and other events, and 
				conducting seminars and training classes at various Federal 
				civilian and military sites and installations throughout her 
				respective, assigned territories. In the course of her work, she 
				frequently makes multiple stops within&nbsp; the locally defined 
				commuting area or travels to remote field locations. The 
				activities in which she engages come within the definition of 
				&quot;fieldwork&quot; as set forth in Section 102-5.30 of the FMR, which 
				permits the use of Government passenger carrier transportation 
				between an associate's residence and place of GSA employment 
				under certain circumstances.</p>
				<p>This associate is required to visit customers at various 
				Federal agency sites and other locations for the purpose of 
				promoting GSA products and services to current and potential 
				clients. She provides advice and general assistance, engages in 
				customer outreach programs , and participates in seminars, 
				workshops, and product/services exhibitions. She often has to 
				leave early in the morning to drive to her destinations or 
				events, and in the evening she may not be near a Government 
				facility to return the vehicle.</p>
				<p>On occasion, it is more cost effective for an associate to 
				use a Government vehicle to travel from his or her residence to 
				that day's business destinations than from a Government 
				facility. Efficiency and productivity will be increased because 
				the associate will not have to travel to one location to pick up 
				a vehicle and then proceed to his or her destination, which may 
				be in the opposite direction from the place at which the vehicle 
				is normally housed. This time savings allows associated to more 
				effectively interact with their customers in and around their 
				respective territories because greater number of scheduled and 
				&quot;cold call&quot; visits can be made within a targeted area. Moreover, 
				this savings in travel time ensures sufficient time for 
				associates to set up for events, seminars and workshops within 
				their eight- or nine-hour workdays. For those associates in 
				remote locales, a Government motor vehicles is the only means of 
				transportation, since public transportation is not readily 
				available. These Circumstances are of a continuing nature.</p>
				<p>3. The use of Government vehicle for home-to-work 
				transportation by the associate listed above will substantially 
				increase the efficiency and economy of GSA under the 
				circumstances described and is in full conformance with the 
				language and intent of FMR Part 102-5. The use is not for the 
				personal comfort and convenience of the associate, and the 
				transportation is approved only on days when the associate 
				actually performs fieldwork of the nature described above. the 
				monthly Home-To-Work Transportation Log (GSA Form 3601) will be 
				submitted monthly and maintained as required by GSA Order OAD P 
				5620.1.</p>
				<p>4. This determination and approval shall be updated as 
				necessary and re-certified every two years from the date of this 
				authorization.</p>
